# remote_base

I have several old Lacrosse technology weather sensors and I wanted to integrate them in my ESPHome world.

## Hardware

Easy: I have attached a 433MHz receiver (SRX882) to an ESP32.

## Software

This *remote_base* component add the support of the 433MHz protocol for those sensors.
Unfortunately, the original component remote_receiver has not been designed to enable easily the data received to be sent to sensors.
The workaround is therefore to return a string containing between 1 and 3 sensors values separated with semicolon. Each value has the form xxyyz with xx=TX or WS (protocol), yy=device address and z = sensor type (0: temperature, E: hygrometry, P: pression)
